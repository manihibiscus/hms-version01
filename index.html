         <p>Hospital Management System is a system enabling hospitals to manage information
            and data related to all aspects of healthcare – processes, providers, patients,
            and more, which in turn ensures that processes are completed swiftly and effectively.

         <p>In India, hospitals have existed from ancient times.
            Even in 6th century BC, during the time of Buddha,
            there were a number of the hospitals to look after
            the handicapped and the poor. The outstanding hospitals in India
            at that time were those built by King Ashoka (273–232 BC).

            Books written by Arabian and European travellers (around AD 600) reveal that the study of medicine
            in India was in its bloom. The zeal of the native vaidyas for the investigation of the Indian flora
            slackened for want of encouragement.

            The invasion of foreigners in the 10 th century AD brought with them their own physicians called Hakims.
            The use of the Allopathetic system of medicine commenced in the 16th century with the arrival of European
            missionaries. It was during the British rule that there was progress in the construction of hospitals.
            Organized medical training was started in the 19th. century.

            The Portuguese founded the Royal Hospital in Goa between 1510 and 1515, and later the Jesuits introduced
            basic
            general medical training programme at the hospital. In 1842 this was converted into school of medicine and
            surgery.
            Although the Portuguese first brought modern medicine to India, it was the French and the British who later
            established
            the first hospitals in 1664 and 1668, respectively.

            The first medical school was started in Calcutta, followed by Madras in 1846. Along with the spread of
            British
            rule over the country, local government encouraged establishment of dispensaries at sub-division and
            district
            level. At provincial levels the hospitals were converted into teaching hospitals attached to medical
            colleges.
            In 1885, there were 1250 hospitals and dispensaries in British India.
